## CodeWars
This is a repo with the copies of the katas I've completed on [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/).

## What is CodeWars?
It's a website where you face challenges - katas. Kata are real code challenges focused 
on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others 
focus on complex problem solving. Each kata is crafted for and by the community.
